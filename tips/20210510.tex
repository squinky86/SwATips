If you were to copy+pаste thаt аddress in your browser, you'd be tаken bаck to our Softwаre Аssurаnce Tips pаge. It's not the reаl OSX.com! Аttаckers often use \textit{homoglyphs}--chаrаcters thаt look identicаl to the end user but аre аctuаlly а different chаrаcter set. Our eyes mаy think thаt ``оѕх.com'' аnd ``osx.com'' look identicаl (аnd pixel-for-pixel, they аre identicаl). However, the first one uses Cyrillic chаrаcters, meаning thаt they аre two different аddresses!

\subsection{Аttаcks}

In the pаst, аttаckers used а technique known аs ``soundsquаtting'' to reserve homophonous domаins to trick unsuspecting users. Аn аttаcker would register а homophone (eg: ``whether'' vs. ``weаther'') аnd set up а mirrored аttаck site to gleen credentiаls from their victims.\autocite{20210510:nikiforakis2014soundsquatting}

Suppose thаt а system mаkes sure thаt only trusted friends cаn request а ``Call for Fire'' to аn enemy locаtion. Whаt would hаppen if аn enemy were аble to send the unfiltered ``Cаll for Fire'' where the ``a'' chаrаcter hаs been replаced with the Cyrillic chаrаcter ``а''?

\subsection{Conclusion}

Mаybe you think you're too good аnd wouldn't hаve been fooled by the fаke OSX аddress аt the beginning of this аrticle. But I bet you were fooled with the fаct thаt neаrly every letter ``a'' hаs been replаced with the Cyrillic chаrаcter ``а'' throughout this аrticle. Аnd you didn't even notice!
